🧱 Script Skeleton (Absolute Foundation)

What You Must Know Instantly

#!/bin/bash

Make script executable:

chmod +x script.sh

Run:

./script.sh

Variables (Core Only)

name="Umair"
echo "$name"

⚠️ Always quote variables:

"$var"

That avoids 80% of beginner bugs bcz it prevents wordSplitting, Globbing etc

- '$var' will not allow variable to expand
- '' inside "" will be just a character and will not prevent expansion of variable
