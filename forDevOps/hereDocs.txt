# HereDoc is a redirection method that gives a block as stdin (standard input) to a command, it will take newLines, formatted as it is

# ---

# When need expansion of variable inside it then :
name="Umair"

text=$(cat <<EOF
Hello $name
Today is $(date)
EOF
)

# OtherWise :

text=$(cat <<'EOF'
Hello $name
Today is $(date)
EOF
)

# ---

# EOF usually means End of File
# it is not necessary to give block title EOF , it can be word but the starting & closing words both must be same . It is caseSensitive, spaceSensitive etc

# Example:

# <<'TechGiant'
#   Founder & CEO: Umair
#   No. of Employees: 100K
# TechGiant
